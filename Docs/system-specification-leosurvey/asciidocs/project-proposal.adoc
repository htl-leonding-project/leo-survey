=== Project Background
At the moment, there is no good method for Teachers or Students to create
Surveys for special Circumstances. If someone wants to make a Survey, he has
to do it on paper and copy it for everyone who should take part in it.

=== Project Goals
The main goal of LeoSurvey is to create a tool with which someone can create,
take part in or evaluate Surveys.

=== Project Functions
* creating of Questionnaires
* creating of Surveys
* textual evaluation
* graphical evaluation

=== Project Description
The software is for creating Surveys. The creator of the Survey can choose
between some built-in Questionnaires, or he can create a new one.
Then he can fill it with his questions. The creator can then share his
survey with the people who want to participate in the survey.

=== Stakeholder
* creator of the survey
* participants

=== Project Result
LeoSurvey is a tool to create and take part in Surveys featuring multiple
Questionnaires like multiple choice or yes/no questions.
